    <h1>Leadership & Institutional Roles</h1>

    <p>
      Throughout my academic career, I have been entrusted with significant leadership responsibilities that allowed me 
      to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of agricultural education, institutional governance, and research 
      development. My work has consistently focused on strengthening academic structures, promoting innovation, and 
      aligning educational initiatives with national agricultural priorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya (JNKVV), Jabalpur, I had the privilege of serving in several senior 
      roles that played a key part in shaping institutional policies and academic direction.
    </p>

    <p style="font-weight: 600; margin-top: 25px;">Key leadership positions held:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Dean, Faculty of Agriculture, JNKVV, Jabalpur</li>
      <li>Director of Research, JNKVV, Jabalpur</li>
      <li>Director of Instruction, JNKVV, Jabalpur</li>
      <li>Dean, College of Agriculture, JNKVV, Jabalpur</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Through these roles, I actively contributed to curriculum modernization, research capacity building, policy 
      formulation, and the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices. My leadership initiatives focused on 
      creating a strong academic foundation while encouraging innovation, collaboration, and excellence in teaching 
      and research.
