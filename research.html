    <h1>My Contributions to Research</h1>

    <p>
      My research journey has been shaped by a deep commitment to advancing agricultural science and creating practical,
      field-oriented solutions that strengthen farming systems. Through my work, I have continually sought to bridge
      the gap between scientific discovery and real-world impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had the privilege of establishing and leading the Seed Technology Centre and Referral Seed Testing Laboratories
      under ICAR-sponsored projects, contributing to the development of strong institutional frameworks, modern
      research infrastructure, and reliable seed quality systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Capacity building has been a central pillar of my professional work. I designed and delivered specialised
      training programmes for professionals engaged in seed production, certification, and trade across India, helping
      to raise technical standards and professional excellence within the agricultural sector.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mentorship has always remained close to my heart. Guiding undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral scholars has
      allowed me to nurture curiosity, scientific discipline and innovative thinking. My enduring goal has been to
      inspire young researchers to contribute meaningfully to the future of agriculture.
