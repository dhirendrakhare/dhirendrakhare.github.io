  <h1>My Contributions to Research</h1>

  <p>
    My research journey has been shaped by a deep commitment to advancing agricultural science and delivering
    field-driven solutions that strengthen farming systems and agricultural sustainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had the privilege of establishing and leading the Seed Technology Centre and Referral Seed Testing Laboratories
    under ICAR-sponsored initiatives, creating robust research frameworks and modern scientific infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Capacity building has been central to my professional vision. I designed and delivered specialised training
    programmes for professionals engaged in seed production, certification, and agricultural trade across India.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mentorship has always been a defining element of my academic life. Guiding undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral
    scholars has been both a responsibility and a passion, inspiring future leaders in agricultural science.
