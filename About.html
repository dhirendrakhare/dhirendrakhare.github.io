    <h2>Professional Overview</h2>

    <p>
      For over three decades, I have devoted my academic life to the advancement of agricultural science,
      with a focused specialisation in Plant Breeding and Seed Technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have had the privilege of serving in senior academic and administrative leadership roles, including
      Dean of Faculty of Agriculture, Director of Research, Director of Instruction, and Dean of the College of Agriculture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mentoring undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral scholars has been one of the most fulfilling aspects
      of my professional journey. My work has remained centred on crop improvement, genetic enhancement, seed
      quality systems, and sustainable agricultural practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this platform, I share my academic journey, highlight research contributions, and present ongoing
      initiatives that reflect a lifelong commitment to education, innovation, and scientific excellence.
