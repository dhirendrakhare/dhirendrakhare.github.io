      <h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Professional Overview</h2>

      <p>
        For over three decades, I have devoted my life to the advancement of agricultural science, specializing in Plant Breeding and Seed Technology. My journey began with a deep fascination for the intricate patterns of plant genetics, which has since evolved into a lifelong commitment to research, teaching, and leadership in the field.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along the way, I have had the honor of serving in senior academic and administrative roles, including Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, Director of Research, Director of Instruction, and Dean of the College of Agriculture. Each position offered the opportunity to foster institutional growth, enhance academic governance, and build research infrastructure that supports both students and the wider scientific community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guiding and mentoring undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral students has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my career. My academic and research pursuits focus on crop improvement, genetic enhancement, seed quality systems, and sustainable farming practices, aiming always to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and practical agricultural solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this platform, I hope to share my professional journey, highlight key contributions, and provide insights into ongoing research and initiatives. It is a reflection of a career dedicated to nurturing knowledge, fostering innovation, and inspiring the next generation of agricultural scientists.
